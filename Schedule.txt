Weekly schedule updated periodically for distributing tasks.

1. Very fast (Wall algorithm) basis generation fixing 
	a.  Check angular momentum conservation
	b.  Account for the fact that wall algorithm may give bases larger than M

2. Another round of spherical verification
	a. Check basis generation
	b. Go to larger N with very fast basis generation
	c. Check every single aspect of the code
3. Fixing setting M7
4. M7 sims
	a. Check for sign problem in a larger system (optimise Bose-Dumps not to store superfluous overlaps
	   (use 8-fold symmetry)
	b. Reproduce excitaiton spectrum
	c. Create plotting scripts for reading M7 output
	(d.) Initiator plots
