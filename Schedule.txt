Weekly schedule updated periodically for distributing tasks.

-- 18/11/21 -- 

Ahad?
1. Attempt Wilkin procedure for optimising the spherical Hamiltonian generation
	a. Test if same procedure produces correct elements by adapting Disc_Testing.py for sphere 
	b. If not, adapt the off-diagonal construction to include negative angular momentum transfers within 
	   the basis occupations
Marcell?
2. Optimisation for basis generation using the 'Wall algorithm'
	a. Derek's zero momentum transfer wall move can be systematically applied to produce only L 
	   conserving basis states (question: does it produce all of them?)
	b. Create recursive algorithm for generating wall positions for allowed wall moves
	   starting from putting a single particle in the m=L state and the rest in m=0 state
        c. test that basis sets are equivalent
Ahad? Marcell?
3. Expressing the current density in occupation number representation
	a. Finding single Landau level matrix overlap of current operator
	b. Algorithm for constructing the many-body current operator expectation 
	   and uncertainty 

4. (Optional) Analytic formula for the no. bases with fixed N, L, M
5. Discussion with Robert regarding FCIQMC -- next week
